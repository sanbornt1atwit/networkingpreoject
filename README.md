# Tic-tac-toe

This is our final project for Network Programming. For this project, we made a Tic Tac Toe game. 

## Introduction

This game is programmed based on Java. This is a multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game through a client-server structure.  Since this is a two-player game, we did not use a server corresponding to multiple clients. Player 1 will use the Server to play the game, and player two will use the Client to play the game. For the game display interface, we used JPanel and JFrame to render.

## Features

The features of our application.

- This game allows two players to play the game.
- Player can start the game.
- When the player enters the wrong number to start the game, they will receive a message to rerun the program.
- When each player makes a move, each window will update the latest action right away.
- When there is a winner, the game is over, and it will let both players know who is the winner of the game.
- When there is no winner, the game will let both players know this is a draw game.
- When the player closes the window, the connection will close automatically.
