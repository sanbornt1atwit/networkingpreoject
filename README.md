Tic-tac-toe
This is our final project for Network Programming. For this project, we made a Tic Tac Toe game. This game is programmed based on Java. This is a multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game through client-server structure.  Since this is a two-player game, we did not use a server corresponding to multiple clients. Player 1 will use the Server to play the game, and player 2 will use the Client to play the game. For the game display interface, we used JPanel and JFrame to render.
